# H1

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1

Alt-H2

#### Math!
-------------------------------

In first grade I learned that 5 > 3 and 2 < 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -> 2 -> 3. 9 <- 8 <- 7.
Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2

#### Making lists
------------------------

The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:

* Red Apples
* Purple Grapes
* Green Kiwifruits

Let's get crazy:

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
    mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
    sit amet velit.

2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

What about some code **in** a list? That's insane, right?

1. In Ruby you can map like this:

        ['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }

2. In Rails, you can do a shortcut:

        ['a', 'b'].map(&:uppercase)

Some people seem to like definition lists
<dl>
  <dt>Lower cost</dt>
  <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
  <dt>Easier to use</dt>
  <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
</dl>

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

#### Robot Code
------------

Maybe you want to print `robot` to the console 1000 times. Why not?

    def robot_invasion
      puts("robot " * 1000)
    end

You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.
How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?

    <div class="footer">
        &copy; 2015 Mad Islander
    </div>


#### Playing the blame game
----------------------

If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:

> I, at any rate, am convinced that she does not throw apples.

Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:

> A la peche moulle moulle moulle, je ne pleus allez, Mamon...
>
> I am thinking about change,
> big change, the earch shattering, mind-blowing kind of change that
> your family never expects...
> I simply love seeing the looks on their faces.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

#### Would you like this corner table?
-------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
